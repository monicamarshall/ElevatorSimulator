# ElevatorSimulator
Java Implementation for simulating the functions of an elevator

#Assumptions:  

1. We have 10 users using one single elevator.

2. There are 7 floors, level 0 through level 6.

3. There are only 2 directions in which the elevator is moving ( up or down ).

4. There are 4 different states the elevator is in:  stopped, moving, door closing, door opening.

5. For each elevator user, the floor is selected randomly (number between 0 and 6 ).

6. For each elevator trip, the number of floors up or down is calculated and printed to the console.

7. If the floor selected is the same as the current floor, the elevator will stay stationary.

8. The main thread is run in a ThreadPool of 3 Threads running the main method concurrently.

9. The method goToFloor in the elevator is synchronized.

#Main routine activity:

8. The main routine simulates 10 users using the elevator one at a time, with a 2 seconds wait between them. 

#Example Output:
Elevator is stopped at level 0
